Hello, I'm Rohan!

I graduated from Rutgers University with a Bachelor of Science in both Evolutionary Anthropology and Genetics, two fields with very different methods that are nonetheless interested in very similar questions. 

I am currently a third-year doctoral candidate in the Bioinformatics program at the [Institute for Genomic Evolutionary Medicine](https://igem.temple.edu/) at Temple University, in the [lab of Dr. Sudhir Kumar](https://kumarlab.net/home). 

## About Me

Bones-wise, I am a graduate of the [Turkana Basin Institute Origins Field School](https://www.turkanabasin.org/fieldschool/) affiliated with Stony Brook University and the National Museums of Kenya. I spent a semester at active field sites at both the Mpala Research Center and the Turkana Basin Institute, studying ecology, geology, fossil paleontology/anthropology, and archaeology.

Genes-wise, I completed an honors thesis on copy number variation in autism-associated genes under the advisory of [Dr. Jinchuan Xing](https://xinglab.genetics.rutgers.edu/) of the Genetics Department and [Dr. Erin Vogel](https://evolution.rutgers.edu/people/ches-faculty/ches-faculty-member/74-ches-faculty/118-erin-r-vogel) of the Anthropology Department. Material from this thesis would later be published as a paper for which I was a co-first author that was [published in *IJMS,*](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/17/13248) as well as a [paper in *eLife*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/82809).
